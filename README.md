# 30DayMapChallenge2024 by Rbanism

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is an event which gathers mappers on social media each November since 2019. The challenge is to produce a map for each of the 30 days of November, following the set of themes / topics / constraints set by the organisers. The list of themes for November 2024 is not yet known, but you can see the 2023 challenge [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b74577-642a-42e5-a191-085259cb6f83). Historically, some themes and constraints reoccur. We have identified them [here](https://github.com/Rbanism/30DayMapChallenge2024/blob/main/README.md#frequency-of-topics-in-previous-challenges) using challenges from previous years (cf. [R code here](https://github.com/Rbanism/30DayMapChallenge2024/blob/main/topics/historicalTopics.html).

This year, we would like to participate to the #30DayMapChallenge2024 as a group: Rbanism. Given our community focus on the programming language R, we add a constraint to the challenge, which is that **each map has to be made using R**. To make it more manageable, we spread the task of producing 30 maps among ourselves, and we provide inspiration and data by including BK bachelor students' GIS production. That way, your task is *only* to reproduce the map using with R.

If you would like to join the challenge, you can register your interest to [Rbanism](mailto:rbanism@tudelft.nl), pick a theme you would like to work on and eventually post your map as part of the #30DayMapChallenge2024_Rbanism. If you need inspiration, checkout the BK Student GIS gallery and invite them to pair up.

It can be a **great opportunity to work on your mapping skills with R, to experiment with new packages and new functions, and to link with fellow mappers at TU Delft**. We're looking forward to see what Rbanism comes up with as a community, and will host the result on our [website](rbanism.org).
